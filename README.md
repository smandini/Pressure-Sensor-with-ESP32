# Pressure-Sensor-with-ESP32
-- Hey all. We will go over how to interface the Pressure Transmitter sensor with ESP32 and ADC 16-bit ADS1115 --

#### The top highlight we should know: Pressure sensor measured through analog signal as an input.
Analog signal is a type of signal that can have any value within a range between 4 to 20mA and it is used to read real world conditions, one of which is pressure.

We need these materials to set up the pressure sensor on the pipe.
