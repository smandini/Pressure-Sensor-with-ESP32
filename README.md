--We will go over how to interface the Pressure Transmitter sensor with ESP32--

Hey, all. I'm trying to make a digital note from my small project using Pressure sensor with ESP32. If you have any question please kindly ask me through my email.

#### The top highlight we should know: Pressure sensor measured through analog signal as an input.
Analog signal is a type of signal that can have any value within a range between 4 to 20mA and it is used to read real world conditions, one of them are pressure.
